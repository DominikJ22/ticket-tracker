## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Express, Node, and  MongoDB. 

I created a ticket track application that users can use to illustrate problems they may have with any of my projects. I find this app useful in taking in feedback from my website clients and individuals that use my apps.

## Optimizations
I used bootstrap to make sure their is a simple color interface for users and I have provided a variety of options to illustrate issues.

## Lessons Learned:

In building this app I learned how to effectivly use EJS and form an app using older version of code into a fullstack application.
I learned how to use EJS syntax and connect it to my MongoDB database.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
